Scrapy Documentation:
Release 0.4 01/13/96

  Scrapy is very easy to use. In fact, you probably already know how to use it. If you have used Scrapbook then you know how to use Scrapy, since they are very similar. The difference is Scrapy has a couple more features and supports drag-and-drop. Unfortunately, it does not yet support handling graphics.

  There's an on-line help file to explain anything you don't already know about the program, so you can probably go right ahead and start using it now.
